# Ignite SplashScreen

This plugin helps you add a Splash Screen to your React Native app to:
* Hide the fact that we are loading JS
* Do stuff to get the app ready
* Decide in JS when to hide the splashscreen

This is setuping the [react-native-splash-screen](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen) package and setting some defaults.

Please refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/crazycodeboy/react-native-splash-screen) for more precision.

We also recommend checking [react-native-make](https://github.com/bamlab/react-native-make) to set your custom splash image in one command.

## Adding the plugin

```sh
ignite add splashscreen
```

## Removing the plugin

```sh
ignite remove splashscreen
```

## Compatibility

This has been tested with React Native [0.61.4](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.61.4).
